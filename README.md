## ðŸ‘‹ About This Project
This project was part of my learning journey in data engineering.
My goal was to build a real ETL pipeline from an open API using Python and Pandas,
and to understand how automation and data pipelines work in practice.

# âš¡ EnergyZero ETL Project (Week 8 â€“ Data Processing and ETL with Python)

This project is part of the **VIT Data Engineering learning module (Week 8)**.  
The goal is to build a complete **ETL pipeline** (Extract â€“ Transform â€“ Load) using **Python and Pandas**,  
to fetch and process real electricity price data from the **EnergyZero API**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The main purpose of this project is to:
- Get real energy price data from the **EnergyZero API**
- Process and clean the data using **Pandas**
- Calculate and add **Price_with_VAT (+21%)**
- Save the transformed data in **Parquet format**
- Optionally automate the workflow with **Apache Airflow** and **Docker**
